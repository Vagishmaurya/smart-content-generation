        hint: "Think about how this relates to retirement expectations",
        model_answer: "The expression refers to the common retirement lifestyle where older people tend to slow down and enjoy a relaxing, laid-back lifestyle. The author uses this to contrast with their own active post-retirement choice to take up cycling as a challenging adventure, showing that they chose an unconventional path compared to typical retirees their age."

        question: "What made Vishav and her husband confident to venture into Uttarakhand on their bicycles?",
        hint: "Look for factors related to their familiarity with the region",
        model_answer: "Vishav and her husband were confident because they had lived in Uttarakhand's capital, Dehradun, their entire lives. They were acclimatized to the cold winds and narrow winding roads of the state. Additionally, they were familiar with almost all the scenic mountain trails in the region, which gave them the confidence to undertake this challenging journey."

        question: "What was the strong passion that prompted the retired couple to take up this adventurous journey?",

        model_answer: "The couple developed a strong passion for cycling, which started with short daily rides but evolved as they found themselves looking forward to these rides more and more. Their passion was fueled by their desire to discover and explore their surroundings in a way they never had time to before. Their simple hobby turned into a project as they began participating in cyclotrons and other cycling events, eventually leading to the adventurous idea of traveling across the state on bicycles."

        hint: "Look for the sensory experience described in the passage",
        model_answer: "According to the author, cycling is the most thrilling way to enjoy and appreciate Uttarakhand's beauty. She believes this because of the unique sensory experience it provides: feeling sunlight filtering through trees, cool breezes caressing the face while riding, and enjoying breathtaking views of sal forests and valleys. The experience of pedalling across the state offers a more intimate connection with nature that she describes as 'truly inexplicable.'"

It took them through picturesque locations such as Kimadi, Hathi Paon, Mussoorie, and Chaar Dukaan, right up to George Everest point. This approximately 100km ride holds special significance for them."

        hint: "Look for the elements that make cycling in Uttarakhand unique",
        model_answer: "A cyclist expects diverse challenging terrain and beautiful scenery from an adventurous mountain trip. According to the passage, cyclists in Uttarakhand specifically expect steep slopes, sharp curves, endless hills, lush forests, and off-road experiences. Vishav and Kamal Jeet did indeed get these experiences from their 100 km ride, as the author explicitly states that this route 'encapsulates all the elements that one expects while cycling here,' followed by listing those exact features."

// Reading Comprehension Questions for Text II (The Poem)

        question: "The poem describes the _____________ of going downhill on a bicycle.",
        options: ["enjoyment", "happiness", "excitement", "satisfaction"],
        answer: 2,  // excitement (index 2)
        explanation: "The poem vividly captures the excitement and thrill of riding a bicycle downhill through descriptions of speed, freedom, and the physical sensations of the experience."
    },
    {
        id: "q2_2",
        type: "essay",
        question: "Which line(s) depict the freedom like that of a bird that the poet enjoys?",
        hint: "Look for comparisons between the boy and a bird",
        model_answer: "The lines \"O bird, see; see, bird, I fly\" and \"For a golden moment share Your feathery life in air!\" clearly depict the freedom like that of a bird that the poet enjoys. These lines show the boy comparing his bicycle ride to flying like a bird, feeling the same sense of freedom and exhilaration in the air."
    },
    {
        id: "q2_3",
        type: "essay",
        question: "Which is the experience the boy is sharing with the bird? What is the golden moment he is referring to?",
        hint: "Consider the sensation of movement described in the poem",
        model_answer: "The boy is sharing the experience of flight/soaring with the bird - the sensation of moving freely through the air with speed. The 'golden moment' refers to that precious, perfect instant when the boy feels completely free while speeding downhill on his bicycle, experiencing the same joyful liberation that birds experience when flying. It's called 'golden' because it's rare, valuable, and fleeting, capturing a moment of pure joy and transcendence."
    },
    {
        id: "q2_4",
        type: "essay",
        question: "What is the meaning of 'full of bliss' here? Can the boy find this kind of bliss in the world where he lives?",
        hint: "Consider what brings supreme joy in the poem",
        model_answer: "'Full of bliss' refers to a world filled with supreme joy and happiness. The boy is questioning whether there is anything else in the world that can bring as much joy as riding downhill on a bicycle. He believes that this particular experience of freedom and exhilaration is unmatched, suggesting that while the world offers many pleasures ('full of bliss'), this specific sensation of speeding downhill, feeling like a bird in flight, represents a unique form of bliss that cannot be easily found in other activities in his everyday world."
    },
    {
        id: "q2_5",
        type: "essay",
        question: "There is a comparison in the third stanza. What is it?",
        hint: "Look at how the boy describes himself in relation to the bird",
        model_answer: "In the third stanza, the boy compares himself to a bird. He asks the bird if the joy of flying is similar to what he feels while cycling downhill. Then he states that although he is just a boy, for a brief moment ('golden moment'), he shares the bird's 'feathery life in air' - meaning he experiences the same sensation of flight and freedom that birds naturally enjoy."
    },
    {
        id: "q2_6",
        type: "essay",
        question: "What is the meaning of the last two lines of the poem? Does \"toil\" mean dedication, determination, and will power to climb the hill? What is the reward here?",
        hint: "Consider the effort-reward relationship described at the end",
        model_answer: "The last two lines ('Who climbs with toil, wheresoe'er, Shall find wings waiting there') mean that those who make the effort to climb uphill, regardless of where they are, will be rewarded with the ability to soar like birds on their way down. Yes, 'toil' does refer to the dedication, determination, and willpower needed to climb the hill - the hard work and effort. The reward is the 'wings' - the feeling of flight, freedom, and exhilaration that comes with the downhill journey. This is a metaphor suggesting that hard work and struggle often lead to moments of joy and liberation."
