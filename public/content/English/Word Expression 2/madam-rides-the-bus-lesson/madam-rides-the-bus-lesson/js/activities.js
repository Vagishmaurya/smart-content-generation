    passage: `Once a tourist remarked, "I visited the Eastern States this time — where the people talk in songs and they always dance."

The eastern region of India is no doubt charmingly novel in many of its features. Mizoram, literally the land of Mizos is an expanse of blue-green hills. Mizoram is broken up lenghwise into five major mountain ranges gradually descending from the south to the north. The hills are rugged and their heights uneven. The name of the state Mizoram is made of two words. 'Mi' means human beings, 'Zo' means a hill. So, a 'Mizo' is a human dweller of a hill; Mizoram means the land of the hill-dwellers. Aizawl is the capital town of the State built in tiers along the hill.

The Mizos have three main festivals — Mim Kut, Chapchar Kut and Pawl Kut. These festivals are associated with their agricultural activities during which they enjoy life by singing and dancing. The Mizos, blessed as they are with a beautiful environment and rich culture, are a vibrant and social people. They love to dance as much as they love to sing. They boast a number of folk and community dances handed down from one generation to the other through the ages. The dances are expressions of the gay, carefree spirit of the Mizos. It should be noted here that these dances are not intended for stage performance, rather they have been evolved for community involvement and participation.`,
