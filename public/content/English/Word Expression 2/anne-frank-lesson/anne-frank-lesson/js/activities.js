// Siege of Leningrad content for listening activity
const siegeOfLeningradContent = `
The Siege of Leningrad, also known as the 900-Day Siege, began on September 8, 1941, when German forces completely encircled the city of Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg.

The siege was one of the longest and most destructive in history, lasting 872 days until January 27, 1944. During this time, the city's civilian population of nearly 3 million people was cut off from all supplies, including food and fuel.

The winter of 1941-1942 was particularly brutal, with temperatures dropping to -30Â°C. Food rations were reduced to just 125 grams of bread per day for many residents - what became known as "blockade grams." People suffered from extreme starvation, and approximately 1.5 million civilians died during the siege, mostly from starvation, cold, and bombardment.

Despite these terrible conditions, the city never surrendered. The people of Leningrad showed remarkable resilience and determination. They cleared rubble after bombings, worked in factories producing military supplies, and even maintained cultural activities like orchestra performances.

A small supply route across Lake Ladoga, known as the "Road of Life," was established during winter when the lake froze solid enough to support trucks. This tenuous lifeline provided minimal supplies and allowed some civilians to evacuate.

The siege was partially broken in January 1943, but was not fully lifted until January 27, 1944. The resilience shown by the citizens of Leningrad remains one of the most remarkable examples of human endurance during World War II.

// Bengal Famine information for project work

    background: `
        The Bengal famine of 1943 was a devastating famine that struck Bengal in British India during World War II. An estimated 2 to 3 million people died of starvation, malnutrition, and disease.
        
        The famine was caused by a complex set of factors including war-time colonial policies, hoarding, price inflation, and natural disasters. British wartime policies including prioritizing military and defense needs over civilian requirements exacerbated the situation.

        Historical photographs documenting the Bengal famine show the devastating impact on the population, including widespread starvation and suffering. These images were captured by photographers like Sunil Janah and became important historical documentation of this tragedy.
