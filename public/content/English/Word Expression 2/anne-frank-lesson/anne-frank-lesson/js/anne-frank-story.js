            <p>The following excerpt is from the diary of Lena Mukhina, a teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when they fortified the city of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad is an important landmark in the history of Russia. The siege of Leningrad lasted from September 1941 to 1944. The city was cut off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously <span class="highlight-vocab">bombarded<span class="vocab-tooltip">attacked repeatedly</span></span> the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in their evil designs.</p>

            <h3>Foreword from The Diary of Lena Mukhina</h3>
            
            <p>No one could possibly have known that the city would remain in the grip of <span class="highlight-vocab">siege<span class="vocab-tooltip">military blockade of a city</span></span> for 872 days and nights. But Leningrad's citizens had begun to feel the breath of war as early as September. Daily air raids and artillery bombardment of residential neighbourhoods drove the city's inhabitants into bomb shelters, several times a day, and for hours at a time. People's initial curiosity in the <span class="highlight-vocab">aftermath<span class="vocab-tooltip">the period following an unpleasant event</span></span> of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear and then, in conditions of <span class="highlight-vocab">appalling<span class="vocab-tooltip">shocking, horrifying</span></span> hunger and cold, to <span class="highlight-vocab">apathy<span class="vocab-tooltip">lack of interest or concern</span></span>. Leningraders welcomed <span class="highlight-vocab">inclement<span class="vocab-tooltip">unpleasant, stormy, harsh</span></span> weather for the reduced visibility it brought. They came to dread sunny days and moonlit nights, when the Germans would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud cover, however, offered no protection from artillery fire: in just over six months from the start of the siege there were only thirty-two days when shells did not explode on the city's streets.</p>

            <p>Hunger soon set in. Between September and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 November — 125 '<span class="highlight-vocab">blockade grams<span class="vocab-tooltip">minimal food rations during the siege</span></span>' for children, dependents and white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians and engineers. Rations of meat, butter, sugar and other food items were <span class="highlight-vocab">severely<span class="vocab-tooltip">extremely, very badly</span></span> reduced. The summer months and the beginning of autumn, when it was still possible to buy food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.</p>

            <p>The following is an excerpt from the beginning of A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe.</p>
            
            <h3>A Journal of the Plague Year</h3>
            
            <p>It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary <span class="highlight-vocab">discourse<span class="vocab-tooltip">conversation, discussion</span></span> that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the <span class="highlight-vocab">invention<span class="vocab-tooltip">creative imagination</span></span> of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.</p>

            <p>But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some <span class="highlight-vocab">vent<span class="vocab-tooltip">outlet, expression</span></span> in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make <span class="highlight-vocab">inspection<span class="vocab-tooltip">examination, investigation</span></span>. This they did; and finding evident <span class="highlight-vocab">tokens<span class="vocab-tooltip">signs, indications</span></span> of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon, it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus — Plague 2. Parishes infected 1.</p>
