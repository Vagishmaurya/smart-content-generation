            <h3>How Can We Control Anger?</h3>
            
            <p>Do you get angry when your mother switches off the television? Do you get upset when you lose a game? Do you crib when your teacher does not pay attention to you? Most of us can have "yes" as an answer to one or more of these situations. Anger sometimes gets the better of us and leaves us to regret the consequences later. The question is 'How can we control anger?'</p>
            
            <p>Anger is a normal and healthy emotion only if we know how to respond to it. Uncontrolled anger can often harm us directly or indirectly whether we realise or not. Before we learn to address the issue, let us revisit the concept of anger. Anger is nothing but absence of peace with oneself, people or situations around us. And we express it either by being <span class="highlight-vocab">assertive<span class="vocab-tooltip">confident and direct in dealing with others</span></span> or <span class="highlight-vocab">aggressive<span class="vocab-tooltip">ready or likely to attack or confront</span></span>.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">assertive</div>
                <div class="definition">confident and direct in dealing with others</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">aggressive</div>
                <div class="definition">ready or likely to attack or confront</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Let us all become the managers of our own anger. When angry, take a few moments to calm down (take five deep breaths, count up to ten, drink water, change your place) before responding. More often than not we do not have control over the situations that distress us. Getting physically active reduces stress. Funny dances, clapping, thumping your feet, a walk, making funny faces at the mirror, etc., go a long way in helping us let go of the distress anger or the <span class="highlight-vocab">frustration<span class="vocab-tooltip">the feeling of being upset or annoyed</span></span> inside us. Once we have our feelings under control, go through all the aspects of the situation and try to see the same situation from different perspectives. If it is a problem try to equip yourself with a few solutions before entering the same situation. Avoid holding a <span class="highlight-vocab">grudge<span class="vocab-tooltip">a persistent feeling of ill will or resentment</span></span> with people and learn when to seek help from others. Realising your own shortcomings can become one of the greatest strengths of character over the years to come.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">frustration</div>

            </div>

                <div class="definition">a persistent feeling of ill will or resentment</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We can never control circumstances, people or situations as they are constantly changing. The only thing we can control is our response. So we have to increase our capacity to tolerate, ability to understand, and learn to nurture love for others.</p>

            <h3>On Violence</h3>
            
            <p>There is a great deal of violence in the world. There is physical violence and also inward violence. Physical violence is to kill another, to hurt other people consciously, deliberately or without thought, to say cruel things, full of <span class="highlight-vocab">antagonism<span class="vocab-tooltip">active hostility or opposition</span></span> and hate and inwardly, inside the skin, to dislike people, to hate people, to criticise people. Inwardly, we are always quarrelling, battling, not only with others, but with ourselves. We want people to change, we want to force them to our way of thinking.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">antagonism</div>
                <div class="definition">active hostility or opposition</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>In the world, as we grow up, we see a great deal of violence, at all levels of human existence. The ultimate violence is war — the killing for ideas, for so-called religious principles, for nationalities, the killing to preserve a little piece of land. To do that, man will kill, destroy, <span class="highlight-vocab">maim<span class="vocab-tooltip">wound or injure someone so that part of the body is permanently damaged</span></span>, and also be killed himself. There is enormous violence in the world, the rich wanting to keep people poor, and the poor wanting to get rich and in the process hating the rich. And you, being caught in society, are also going to contribute to this.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">maim</div>
                <div class="definition">wound or injure someone so that part of the body is permanently damaged</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>There is violence between husband, wife, and children. There is violence, antagonism, hate, cruelty, ugly criticism, anger — all this is <span class="highlight-vocab">inherent<span class="vocab-tooltip">existing in something as a permanent characteristic</span></span> in man, inherent in each human being. It is inherent in you. And education is supposed to help you to go beyond all that, not merely to pass an examination and get a job. You have to be educated so that you become a really beautiful, healthy, sane, rational human being, not a brutal man with a very clever brain who can argue and defend his <span class="highlight-vocab">brutality<span class="vocab-tooltip">savage physical violence; great cruelty</span></span>.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">

                <div class="definition">savage physical violence; great cruelty</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>You are going to face all this violence as you grow up. You will forget all that you have heard here, and will be caught in the stream of society. You will become like the rest of the cruel, hard, bitter, angry, violent world, and you will not help to bring about a new society, a new world.</p>
            
            <p>But a new world is necessary. A new culture is necessary. The old culture is dead, buried, burnt, exploded, and <span class="highlight-vocab">vaporised<span class="vocab-tooltip">converted into vapour; disappeared</span></span>. You have to create a new culture. A new culture cannot be based on violence. The new culture depends on you because the older generation has built a society based on violence, based on <span class="highlight-vocab">aggressiveness<span class="vocab-tooltip">the quality of being aggressive</span></span> and it is this that has caused all the confusion, all the misery. The older generations have produced this world and you have to change it.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">vaporised</div>

                <div class="definition">the quality of being aggressive</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>You cannot just sit back and say, "I will follow the rest of the people and seek success and position." If you do, your children are going to suffer. You may have a good time, but your children are going to pay for it. So, you have to take all that into account, the outward cruelty of man to man in the name of god, in the name of religion, in the name of self-importance, in the name of the security of the family. You will have to consider the outward cruelty and violence, and the inward violence which you do not yet know.</p>
