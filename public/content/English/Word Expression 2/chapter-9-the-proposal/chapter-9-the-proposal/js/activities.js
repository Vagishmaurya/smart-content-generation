// Vanka story content for listening activity
const vankaStoryContent = `
Vanka Zhukov, a nine-year-old boy, was made an assistant to Alyakhin, the Shoemaker. He didn't go to bed on Christmas Eve. When everyone in the shop had gone to Church, he began to write on a crumpled sheet of paper.

"Dear Grandfather Konstantin, he wrote", I'm writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and all good things from the Lord God. I've no father and mother, and you are all I have left.

Vanka raised his eyes to the dark windowpane. In his imagination he saw his grandfather Konstantin standing there. His grandfather was a night watchman on the estate of a rich man. Konstantin was a small, thin and lively old man of sixty-five whose face was always crinkling with laughter.

In the daytime the old man slept in the servant's kitchen or cracked jokes with the cooks. At night, wrapped in a big sheepskin coat he made rounds of the estate, blowing his whistle at regular intervals. He was always followed by his dogs, Brownie and Eel.

Yesterday I was given a beating. That was because when I was rocking the baby in the cradle, I unfortunately fell asleep. Another day the mistress of the house asked me to clean the fish. I didn't know how, so she rubbed the fish all over my face. My friends laughed at me.

Then there's nothing to eat. In the morning they give me bread, there is porridge for dinner and in the evening only bread again. The master and the mistress eat all the good things themselves. I sleep in the corridor and when the baby cries, I don't get any sleep at all because I've to rock the cradle.

Dear Grandfather, please take me away from here, take me to the village, it's more than I can bear. I'll grind your snuff for you, I'll pray to God to keep you healthy and if I ever do anything wrong, you can beat me as you like.

If you think there's no place for me then I can clean boots or even work as a shepherd boy. Grandfather, it's more than I can bear. I thought of running away to the village, but I don't have any boots.

Dear Grandfather, when they put up the Christmas tree at the big house, please take down a golden walnut for me and hide it in the green box. Ask the young mistress Olga, and say it is for Vanka.

Vanka folded the sheet of paper and then put it in an envelope he had bought the previous day. He thought for a while, then wrote the address: To Grandfather in the Village. He added the words: Konstantin Makarich.

He ran out to the street to post it. Vanka had been told by the clerks that letters were dropped in boxes from where they were carried all over the world on mail coaches drawn by horse and driven by drunken drivers, while the bells jingled.

Vanka ran to the nearest mailbox and put his letter in it. An hour later, lulled by sweetest hopes, he was fast asleep. He dreamed of a stove. His grandfather was sitting beside it, reading out his letter to the cooks. Eel, the dog, was walking round the stove, wagging his tail.
