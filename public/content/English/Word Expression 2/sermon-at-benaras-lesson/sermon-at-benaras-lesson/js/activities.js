        The fascinating and world famous Sanchi stupa is located on a hilltop in Sanchi town, Madhya Pradesh, India. 
        It is one of the most important Buddhist monuments that portrays Buddhist art and sculpture. 
        Starting from the third century BC through the twelfth century AD, it attracts the attention of thousands 
        of visitors round the year including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and historians among others.
        
        This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was built during the Mauryan period. 
        Originally commissioned in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, this huge hemispherical dome consists 
        of a central chamber. In this chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed.
