            <p>In the future, if we want a happier humanity, a happy world, we must tackle the root of the problem. Of course the economy and political power are also causes. But the ultimate cause lies within the human mind. Every human action, verbal or physical, even minor actions, have some <span class="highlight-vocab">motivation<span class="vocab-tooltip">the reason for doing something</span></span>. Proper motivation or proper development is an important factor. Thus, if intelligence is accompanied with human affection and <span class="highlight-vocab">compassion<span class="vocab-tooltip">sympathetic concern for others</span></span>, what I call human feeling, then it is very useful.</p>

            <p>If society's moral values and standards of behaviour become negative, each of us will suffer. Therefore, the intentions of an individual are very much related to the interests of society. There is a definite <span class="highlight-vocab">correlation<span class="vocab-tooltip">connection between two things</span></span>.</p>

            <p>The educational system and family life are two very important areas. In the educational field, one has to take care not only of the brain, but also of one's <span class="highlight-vocab">spiritual<span class="vocab-tooltip">concerning the spirit or soul</span></span> development. I say "spiritual development" not in a religious sense but simply in the sense of having a good and compassionate heart. If one has a compassionate heart, it automatically brings inner strength and allows for less fear and less doubt. Subsequently, one becomes happier and more open-minded, thus making more friends in society.</p>

            <p>The Buddha preached his first sermon at the city of Benaras, most holy of the <span class="highlight-vocab">dipping<span class="vocab-tooltip">bathing or immersion in water</span></span> places on the River Ganges; that sermon has been preserved and is given here. It reflects the Buddha's wisdom about one inscrutable kind of suffering.</p>

            <p>Kisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief she carried the dead child to all her neighbors, asking them for medicine, and the people said, "She has lost her senses. The boy is dead."</p>
            
            <p>At length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her request, "I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I know a physician who can."</p>
            
            <p>And the girl said, "Pray tell me, sir; who is it?" And the man replied, "Go to <span class="highlight-vocab">Sakyamuni<span class="vocab-tooltip">another name for Buddha, meaning "sage of the Sakyas"</span></span>, the Buddha."</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">

            </div>
            
            <p>Kisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, "Lord and Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy."</p>
            
            <p>The Buddha answered, "I want a handful of <span class="highlight-vocab">mustard-seed<span class="vocab-tooltip">tiny round seeds from the mustard plant</span></span>." And when the girl in her joy promised to procure it, the Buddha added, "The mustard-seed must be taken from a house where no one has lost a child, husband, parent, or friend."</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">mustard-seed</div>

            </div>
            
            <p>Poor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house, and the people pitied her and said, "Here is mustard-seed; take it!" But when she asked, "Did a son or daughter, a father or mother, die in your family?" they answered her, "Alas! the living are few, but the dead are many. Do not remind us of our deepest grief." And there was no house but some beloved one had died in it.</p>
            
            <p>Kisa Gotami became <span class="highlight-vocab">weary<span class="vocab-tooltip">tired or exhausted</span></span> and hopeless, and sat down at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as they flickered up and were extinguished again. At last the darkness of the night <span class="highlight-vocab">reigned<span class="vocab-tooltip">prevailed or dominated</span></span> alone. And she considered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up for a few moments and are extinguished again.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>And she thought to herself, "How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all; yet in this valley of <span class="highlight-vocab">desolation<span class="vocab-tooltip">sadness and loneliness</span></span> there is a path that leads him to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness."</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Putting aside the selfishness of her affection for her child, Kisa Gotami had the dead body buried in the forest. Returning to the Buddha, she took refuge in him and found comfort in the Dharma, which is a balm that will soothe all the pains of our troubled hearts.</p>
            
            <p>The Buddha said, "The life of mortals in this world is troubled and brief and combined with pain. For there is not any means by which those that have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings. As ripe fruits are early in danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in danger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both young and adult, both those who are fools and those who are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are subject to death."</p>
            
            <p>"Of those who, <span class="highlight-vocab">overcome<span class="vocab-tooltip">overwhelmed or defeated</span></span> by death, depart from life, a father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations. Mark! while relatives are looking on and <span class="highlight-vocab">lamenting<span class="vocab-tooltip">expressing sorrow or grief</span></span> deeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox that is led to the slaughter. So the world is afflicted with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world."</p>

                <div class="word">overcome</div>

            <p>"Not from weeping nor from grieving will anyone obtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be the greater and his body will suffer. He will make himself sick and pale, yet the dead are not saved by his lamentation. He who seeks peace should draw out the arrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who has drawn out the arrow and has become composed will obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all sorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed."</p>
