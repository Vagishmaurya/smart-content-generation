    <p>It is <span class="highlight-vocab">intriguing<span class="vocab-tooltip">fascinating and curious</span></span> to watch Evelyn function so effortlessly without hearing. In our two-hour discussion she never missed a word. "Men with bushy beards give me trouble," she laughed. "It is not just watching the lips, it's the whole face, especially the eyes." She speaks <span class="highlight-vocab">flawlessly<span class="vocab-tooltip">without a fault or mistake</span></span> with a Scottish <span class="highlight-vocab">lilt<span class="vocab-tooltip">a way of speaking</span></span>. "My speech is clear because I could hear till I was eleven," she says. But that doesn't explain how she managed to learn French and master basic Japanese.</p>

    <p>As for music, she explains, "It pours in through every part of my body. It <span class="highlight-vocab">tingles<span class="vocab-tooltip">causes a slight pricking or stinging sensation</span></span> in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair." When she plays the xylophone, she can sense the sound passing up the stick into her fingertips. By leaning against the drums, she can feel the <span class="highlight-vocab">resonances<span class="vocab-tooltip">echoes of sounds</span></span> flowing into her body. On a wooden platform she removes her shoes so that the vibrations pass through her bare feet and up her legs.</p>

    <p>Not surprisingly, Evelyn delights her audiences. In 1991 she was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's prestigious Soloist of the Year Award. Says master percussionist James Blades, "God may have taken her hearing but he has given her back something extraordinary. What we hear, she feels â€” far more deeply than any of us. That is why she expresses music so beautifully."</p>

    <p>Evelyn confesses that she is something of a <span class="highlight-vocab">workaholic<span class="vocab-tooltip">a person who finds it difficult to stop working</span></span>. "I've just got to work... often harder than classical musicians. But the rewards are enormous." Apart from the regular concerts, Evelyn also gives free concerts in prisons and hospitals. She also gives high <span class="highlight-vocab">priority<span class="vocab-tooltip">great importance</span></span> to classes for young musicians. Ann Richlin of the Beethoven Fund for Deaf Children says, "She is a shining inspiration for deaf children. They see that there is nowhere that they cannot go."</p>

    <p>Evelyn Glennie has already accomplished more than most people twice her age. She has brought percussion to the front of the orchestra, and demonstrated that it can be very moving. She has given inspiration to those who are handicapped, people who look to her and say, 'If she can do it, I can.' And, not the least, she has given enormous pleasure to millions.</p>

    <h3>Part II</h3>
    <h4>The Shehnai of Bismillah Khan</h4>

    <p>EMPEROR Aurangzeb banned the playing of a musical instrument called pungi in the royal residence for it had a shrill unpleasant sound. Pungi became the <span class="highlight-vocab">generic name<span class="vocab-tooltip">a name given to a class or group as a whole</span></span> for reeded noisemakers. Few had thought that it would one day be revived. A barber of a family of professional musicians, who had access to the royal palace, decided to improve the tonal quality of the pungi. He chose a pipe with a natural hollow stem that was longer and broader than the pungi, and made seven holes on the body of the pipe. When he played on it, closing and opening some of these holes, soft and melodious sounds were produced. He played the instrument before royalty and everyone was impressed. The instrument so different from the pungi had to be given a new name. As the story goes, since it was first played in the Shah's chambers and was played by a nai (barber), the instrument was named the 'shehnai'.</p>
