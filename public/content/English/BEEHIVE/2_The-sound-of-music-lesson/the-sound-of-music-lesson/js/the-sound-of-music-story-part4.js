    <p>When India gained independence on 15 August 1947, Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to greet the nation with his shehnai. He poured his heart out into Raag Kafi from the Red Fort to an audience which included Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who later gave his famous 'Tryst with Destiny' speech.</p>

    <p>Bismillah Khan has given many memorable performances both in India and abroad. His first trip abroad was to Afghanistan where King Zahir Shah was so <span class="highlight-vocab">taken in by<span class="vocab-tooltip">attracted or charmed by</span></span> the maestro that he gifted him priceless Persian carpets and other <span class="highlight-vocab">souvenirs<span class="vocab-tooltip">things given in memory of a place, person or event</span></span>. The King of Afghanistan was not the only one to be fascinated with Bismillah's music. Film director Vijay Bhatt was so impressed after hearing Bismillah play at a festival that he named a film after the instrument called Gunj Uthi Shehnai. The film was a hit, and one of Bismillah Khan's compositions, "Dil ka khilona hai toot gaya...", turned out to be a nationwide <span class="highlight-vocab">chartbuster<span class="vocab-tooltip">record-breaker</span></span>! Despite this huge success in the <span class="highlight-vocab">celluloid<span class="vocab-tooltip">old-fashioned way of referring to films</span></span> world, Bismillah Khan's <span class="highlight-vocab">ventures<span class="vocab-tooltip">projects that often involve risk</span></span> in film music were limited to two: Vijay Bhatt's Gunj Uthi Shehnai and Vikram Srinivas's Kannada venture, Sanadhi Apanna. "I just can't come to terms with the artificiality and glamour of the film world," he says with emphasis.</p>

    <p>Awards and recognition came thick and fast. Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to be invited to perform at the prestigious Lincoln Centre Hall in the United States of America. He also took part in the World Exposition in Montreal, in the Cannes Art Festival and in the Osaka Trade Fair. So well known did he become internationally that an auditorium in Teheran was named after him ‚Äî Tahar Mosiquee Ustaad Bismillah Khan.</p>

    <p>National awards like the Padmashri, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan were <span class="highlight-vocab">conferred<span class="vocab-tooltip">given, usually an award or a degree</span></span> on him.</p>

    <p>In 2001, Ustad Bismillah Khan was awarded India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. With the <span class="highlight-vocab">coveted<span class="vocab-tooltip">much desired</span></span> award resting on his chest and his eyes glinting with rare happiness he said, "All I would like to say is: Teach your children music, this is Hindustan's richest tradition; even the West is now coming to learn our music.''</p>

    <p>In spite of having travelled all over the world ‚Äî Khansaab as he is fondly called ‚Äî is exceedingly fond of Benaras and Dumraon and they remain for him the most wonderful towns of the world. A student of his once wanted him to head a shehnai school in the U.S.A., and the student promised to recreate the atmosphere of Benaras by replicating the temples there. But Khansaab asked him if he would be able to transport River Ganga as well. Later he is remembered to have said, "That is why whenever I am in a foreign country, I keep yearning to see Hindustan. While in Mumbai, I think of only Benaras and the holy Ganga. And while in Benaras, I miss the unique mattha of Dumraon."</p>
