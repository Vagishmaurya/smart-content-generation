    <p>The sound of the shehnai began to be considered <span class="highlight-vocab">auspicious<span class="vocab-tooltip">promising to bring good fortune</span></span>. And for this reason it is still played in temples and is an <span class="highlight-vocab">indispensable<span class="vocab-tooltip">without which a piece of work cannot be done</span></span> component of any North Indian wedding. In the past, the shehnai was part of the naubat or traditional <span class="highlight-vocab">ensemble<span class="vocab-tooltip">things (here, instruments) considered as a group</span></span> of nine instruments found at royal courts. Till recently it was used only in temples and weddings. The credit for bringing this instrument onto the classical stage goes to Ustad Bismillah Khan.</p>

    <p>As a five-year old, Bismillah Khan played gilli-danda near a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon in Bihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Bihariji temple to sing the Bhojpuri 'Chaita', at the end of which he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25 kg, a prize given by the local Maharaja. This happened 80 years ago, and the little boy has travelled far to earn the highest civilian award in India â€” the Bharat Ratna.</p>

    <p>Born on 21 March 1916, Bismillah belongs to a well-known family of musicians from Bihar. His grandfather, Rasool Bux Khan, was the shehnai-nawaz of the Bhojpur king's court. His father, Paigambar Bux, and other <span class="highlight-vocab">paternal ancestors<span class="vocab-tooltip">ancestors of the father</span></span> were also great shehnai players.</p>

    <p>The young boy took to music early in life. At the age of three when his mother took him to his maternal uncle's house in Benaras (now Varanasi), Bismillah was fascinated watching his uncles practise the shehnai. Soon Bismillah started accompanying his uncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple of Benaras where Bux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would play the shehnai and Bismillah would sit captivated for hours <span class="highlight-vocab">on end<span class="vocab-tooltip">for a very long time without stopping</span></span>. Slowly, he started getting lessons in playing the instrument and would sit practising throughout the day. For years to come the temple of Balaji and Mangala Maiya and the banks of the Ganga became the young apprentice's favourite haunts where he could practise in solitude. The flowing waters of the Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas that were earlier considered to be beyond the range of the shehnai.</p>

    <p>At the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his uncle to the Allahabad Music Conference. At the end of his recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the young boy's back and said, "Work hard and you shall make it." With the opening of the All India Radio in Lucknow in 1938 came Bismillah's big break. He soon became an often-heard shehnai player on radio.</p>
