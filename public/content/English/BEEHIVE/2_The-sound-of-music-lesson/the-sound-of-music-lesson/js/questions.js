                answer: "Evelyn 'hears' music through her body. Music pours in through every part of her body and tingles in her skin, cheekbones, and even in her hair. When playing the xylophone, she senses sound passing up the sticks into her fingertips. She leans against drums to feel resonances flowing into her body. On wooden platforms, she removes her shoes so vibrations pass through her bare feet and up her legs."

Never!' 2) When a student offered to recreate the atmosphere of Benaras in the USA, he asked if River Ganga could be transported there too. 3) He said, 'Whenever I am in a foreign country, I keep yearning to see Hindustan. While in Mumbai, I think of only Benaras and the holy Ganga.'"

Both were dedicated to their craft from a young age. Both revolutionized their instruments/field. Differences: Evelyn is a Western classical percussionist, while Bismillah Khan played the shehnai in Indian classical tradition.

                answer: "The last four lines suggest that the wind tests our strength - it destroys what is weak but helps the strong grow stronger. The poet says the wind's friendship is valuable, which is why we praise it every day. It symbolizes how challenges can destroy the weak but strengthen those who are resilient."

                text: "How does the poet speak to the wind — in anger or with humour?",
                answer: "The poet begins with a tone of mild irritation and frustration when addressing the wind, especially when saying 'look what you did - you threw them all down.' However, the tone is not deeply angry but rather observational with a touch of humor in acknowledging the wind's mischievous power. By the end, the tone shifts to respect and appreciation, suggesting the initial frustration was part of a larger message about strength and resilience."

                text: "What message is the poet trying to convey through the poem 'Wind'?",
                answer: "The poet uses wind as a metaphor for life's challenges and difficulties. The central message is that we should not be weak or frail in the face of hardship, but rather build ourselves strong through determination and resilience. The poem suggests that the same forces that destroy the weak can actually help the strong become even stronger. It's a call to strengthen ourselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually to withstand life's storms."

                type: "essay",
                text: "How does the poet personify the wind in this poem?",
                answer: "The poet personifies wind by giving it human characteristics and intentions. The wind is portrayed as a conscious being who can deliberately break things, scatter papers, and tear pages. It is described as 'clever at poking fun at weaklings,' suggesting mischievousness and intent. The poet refers to the wind as 'he' and as a 'god' with the power to judge strength and weakness. The wind is described as having the capacity for friendship, and as an entity that can be praised, indicating a relationship similar to that between humans."
