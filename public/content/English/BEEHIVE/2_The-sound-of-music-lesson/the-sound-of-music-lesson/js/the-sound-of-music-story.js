    <h4>Evelyn Glennie Listens to Sound without Hearing It</h4>

    <p>RUSH hour crowds <span class="highlight-vocab">jostle<span class="vocab-tooltip">push roughly</span></span> for position on the underground train platform. A <span class="highlight-vocab">slight<span class="vocab-tooltip">small and thin</span></span> girl, looking younger than her seventeen years, was nervous yet excited as she felt the vibrations of the approaching train. It was her first day at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London and <span class="highlight-vocab">daunting<span class="vocab-tooltip">frightening</span></span> enough for any teenager fresh from a Scottish farm. But this <span class="highlight-vocab">aspiring musician<span class="vocab-tooltip">a person who wants to be a musician</span></span> faced a bigger challenge than most: she was profoundly deaf.</p>

    <p>Evelyn Glennie's loss of hearing had been gradual. Her mother remembers noticing something was wrong when the eight-year-old Evelyn was waiting to play the piano. "They called her name and she didn't move. I suddenly realised she hadn't heard," says Isabel Glennie. For quite a while Evelyn managed to conceal her growing deafness from friends and teachers. But by the time she was eleven her marks had deteriorated and her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing was severely <span class="highlight-vocab">impaired<span class="vocab-tooltip">weakened</span></span> as a result of gradual nerve damage. They were advised that she should be fitted with hearing aids and sent to a school for the deaf. "Everything suddenly looked black," says Evelyn.</p>

    <p>But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing a <span class="highlight-vocab">xylophone<span class="vocab-tooltip">a musical instrument with a row of wooden bars of different lengths</span></span> and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but <span class="highlight-vocab">percussionist<span class="vocab-tooltip">a person who plays the drum, the tabla, etc.</span></span> Ron Forbes spotted her <span class="highlight-vocab">potential<span class="vocab-tooltip">quality or ability that can be developed</span></span>. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. "Don't listen through your ears," he would say, "try to sense it some other way." Says Evelyn, "Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down." Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. "I had learnt to open my mind and body to sounds and vibrations." The rest was sheer determination and hard work.</p>

    <p>She never looked back from that point onwards. She toured the United Kingdom with a youth orchestra and by the time she was sixteen, she had decided to make music her life. She <span class="highlight-vocab">auditioned<span class="vocab-tooltip">gave a short performance so that the director could decide whether she was good enough</span></span> for the Royal Academy of Music and scored one of the highest marks in the history of the academy. She gradually moved from orchestral work to solo performances. At the end of her three-year course, she had captured most of the top awards.</p>

    <p>And for all this, Evelyn won't accept any hint of heroic achievement. "If you work hard and know where you are going, you'll get there." And she got right to the top, the world's most sought-after multi-percussionist with a mastery of some thousand instruments, and hectic international schedule.</p>
