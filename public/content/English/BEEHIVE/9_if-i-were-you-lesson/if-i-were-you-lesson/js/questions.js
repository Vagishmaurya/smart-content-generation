        points: 10,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! Gerrard says this. He says it ironically when the intruder asks him to talk about himself. He is being sarcastic because the intruder is not actually interested in his life story but wants information for his own criminal purposes.',
            incorrect: 'Not quite. Remember that Gerrard is being ironic here - the intruder is not really a "sympathetic audience" but someone trying to get information.'

        question: 'Why does the intruder choose Gerrard as the man whose identity he wants to take on?',
        points: 10,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! The intruder chooses Gerrard because he appears to be a mysterious man who lives alone, frequently goes away suddenly, and doesn\'t see many people. This lifestyle would be perfect for the intruder who is on the run from the police.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not quite right. Think about what the intruder observed about Gerrard\'s lifestyle and how it would help him hide from the police.'
        }

            'The speaker has threatened someone with a gun',
            'The speaker has committed murder with a gun',

        correctOption: 3,
        points: 5,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! Gerrard is pretending to be a violent criminal to convince the intruder that he is also a criminal, which changes the intruder\'s plans.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not right. Remember that Gerrard is creating a fictional story about himself to trick the intruder.'

        points: 15,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! Gerrard appears to be involved in theater or acting, most likely a playwright or director. Evidence includes his phone call about "props" for "rehearsal" and his reference to putting his experience "in my next play."',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not quite right. Look at the end of the play where Gerrard makes a phone call - what does he say about props and rehearsal?'

            'Gerrard says it because he plans to overpower the intruder',
            'The intruder says it because he\'s annoyed by Gerrard\'s clever responses',

            correct: 'Correct! The intruder says this because he\'s frustrated by Gerrard\'s clever and witty responses throughout their conversation.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not right. Think about who is getting frustrated by the other person\'s intelligence and quick thinking.'

        points: 10,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! The intruder says this. He explains that he has already killed a policeman and is wanted for murder, so he has nothing to lose by killing Gerrard too since the death penalty can only be given once.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not quite right. Think about what the intruder has already done and why he feels he has nothing to lose.'

            correct: 'Correct! Gerrard proposes to explain why he leads a mysterious lifestyle with sudden disappearances, which is what the intruder observed and found appealing.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not right. The intruder was specifically interested in Gerrard\'s mysterious habits of disappearing and making phone orders.'

            correct: 'Correct! Gerrard tricks the intruder by convincing him they should escape together, then pushes him into a cupboard when he looks through the door.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not right. Remember the final scene where Gerrard opens a door and the intruder leans forward to inspect it.'

        points: 10,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Correct! There are two "big surprises" in the play. First, the intruder surprises Gerrard by saying he plans to kill him and take his identity. Second, Gerrard surprises the intruder by claiming to be a criminal himself.',
            incorrect: 'That\'s not quite right. Think about the two major revelations that change the course of the play - one from each character.'

        points: 20,
        feedback: {
            correct: 'Excellent! Gerrard exhibits calmness, wit, intelligence, creativity, acting ability, and strategic planning. He remains composed under pressure, creates a convincing story, and executes a clever plan to trap the intruder.',
