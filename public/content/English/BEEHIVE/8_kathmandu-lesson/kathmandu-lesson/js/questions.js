                answer: "Pashupatinath has 'febrile confusion' with priests, hawkers, devotees, tourists, animals creating chaos. People push and elbow for attention. In contrast, Baudhnath stupa has 'a sense of stillness' and is described as a 'haven of quietness.' There are small shops but no crowds."

                text: "How does the author describe Kathmandu's busiest streets?",
                answer: "The author describes Kathmandu as 'vivid, mercenary, religious' with small shrines along narrow busy streets, fruit and flute sellers, hawkers of postcards, shops selling both Western goods and local items. There's noise from film songs, car horns, bicycle bells, and vendors shouting."
            },

                text: "What makes the flute seller different from the other hawkers?",
                answer: "Unlike other hawkers, the flute seller plays his instrument slowly and meditatively without excessive display. He doesn't shout to attract customers. He makes sales in an 'offhanded way' as if selling is incidental to his playing. It seems like a long-established pattern of life."

                text: "\"To hear any flute is to be drawn into the commonality of all mankind.\" Why does the author say this?",
                answer: "The author views the flute as a universal instrument found in all cultures (reed neh, recorder, Japanese shakuhachi, bansuri, Chinese flutes). Despite each having its own fingering and range, flute music has universal appeal. Its sound resembles the human voice, and like humans, it must pause to breathe. This universality creates a connection to shared human experience across cultures."

                type: "essay",
                text: "What contrasts does the author highlight between different parts of Kathmandu?",
                answer: "The author contrasts the chaos of Pashupatinath temple with the stillness of Baudhnath stupa. He juxtaposes religious sites with commercial areas, traditional items with Western goods, quiet contemplation with noisy streets. He shows how tradition coexists with modernity (traditional flutes vs. modern drinks), and how sacred spaces exist alongside ordinary commercial activities."

                id: "eq3",
                type: "essay",
                text: "How does the author's attitude toward home change throughout the passage?",
                answer: "At the beginning, the author seems detached from thoughts of home while exploring Kathmandu. Midway, he considers taking a longer route home through various cities, showing some interest in extending his journey. By the end, he admits to being 'exhausted and homesick' and decides to take a direct flight home. The significance of familiar things (like flute music) grows stronger as he prepares to return."

                text: "What does 'she seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years' suggest?",
                answer: "It suggests that the poet believed his loved one was immortal or unaffected by time and aging."

                type: "paragraph",
                text: "Which lines of the poem say that the passing of time will no longer affect her?",
                answer: "\"No motion has she now, no force— / She neither hears nor sees.\" These lines indicate that she is now beyond the effects of time, as she no longer moves or experiences the world."

                type: "paragraph",
                text: "What does 'rolled round in earth's diurnal course' mean?",
                answer: "It means that she is now part of the earth's daily rotation—she has become one with nature, moving with the rocks, stones, and trees as the earth turns each day. 'Diurnal' refers to the daily rotation of the earth on its axis."

                text: "How does the poet imagine her to be, after death?",
                answer: "The poet imagines her not in a heavenly state but as part of the natural world—integrated with the earth and its elements. She has become part of nature's cycles, rotating with the earth along with 'rocks and stones and trees.'"

                type: "essay",
                text: "How does the poet react to his loved one's death? Does he feel bitter grief or a great peace?",
                answer: "The poet's reaction seems to be one of quiet acceptance rather than bitter grief. There's a sense of resignation and peace in how he describes her becoming part of nature's cycles. The 'slumber' that sealed his spirit suggests he's numbed or distanced from intense pain. He finds solace in seeing her as part of the natural world rather than simply gone."

                id: "dq2",
                type: "essay",
                text: "Why does the poet contrast his earlier perception of her with her state after death?",
                answer: "The contrast emphasizes the transformation from life to death. Initially, he thought she was immune to time ('could not feel the touch of earthly years'), suggesting youthful immortality. After death, ironically, she truly is beyond time's effects but not in the way he imagined—not through immortal life but through becoming part of timeless nature. This contrast highlights his coming to terms with mortality."
            },
            {
                id: "dq3",
                type: "essay",
                text: "What is the significance of the natural imagery in the last two lines of the poem?",
                answer: "The natural imagery ('rocks and stones and trees') emphasizes how death returns us to nature. By associating her with these enduring elements of earth, the poet suggests a kind of immortality through integration with nature rather than personal immortality. The earth's 'diurnal course' (daily rotation) also suggests continuity and cyclical patterns that transcend individual human life. This provides comfort through connection to something eternal."
