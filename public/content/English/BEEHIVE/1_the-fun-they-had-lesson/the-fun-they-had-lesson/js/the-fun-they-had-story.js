    <p>MARGIE even wrote about it that night in her diary. On the page headed 17 May 2157, she wrote, "Today Tommy found a <span class="highlight-vocab">real<span class="vocab-tooltip">physical, printed</span></span> book!"</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">real</div>
        <div class="definition">physical, printed (in contrast to electronic)</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>It was a very old book. Margie's grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper.</p>
    
    <p>They turned the pages, which were yellow and <span class="highlight-vocab">crinkly<span class="vocab-tooltip">with many folds or lines</span></span>, and it was <span class="highlight-vocab">awfully<span class="vocab-tooltip">extremely</span></span> funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to — on a screen, you know. And then when they turned back to the page before, it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">crinkly</div>
        <div class="definition">with many folds or lines</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">awfully</div>
        <div class="definition">extremely</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>"Gee," said Tommy, "what a waste. When you're through with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen must have had a million books on it and it's good for plenty more. I wouldn't throw it away."</p>
    
    <p>"Same with mine," said Margie. She was eleven and hadn't seen as many telebooks as Tommy had. He was thirteen.</p>
    
    <p>She said, "Where did you find it?"</p>
    
    <p>"In my house." He pointed without looking, because he was busy reading. "In the <span class="highlight-vocab">attic<span class="vocab-tooltip">a space just below the roof, used as a storeroom</span></span>."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">attic</div>
        <div class="definition">a space just below the roof, used as a storeroom</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>"What's it about?"</p>
    
    <p>"School."</p>
    
    <p>Margie was <span class="highlight-vocab">scornful<span class="vocab-tooltip">contemptuous; showing you think something is worthless</span></span>. "School? What's there to write about school? I hate school."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">scornful</div>
        <div class="definition">contemptuous; showing you think something is worthless</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Margie always hated school, but now she hated it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head <span class="highlight-vocab">sorrowfully<span class="vocab-tooltip">in a sad manner</span></span> and sent for the County Inspector.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">sorrowfully</div>
        <div class="definition">in a sad manner</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>He was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn't know how to put it together again, but he knew how all right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again, large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked. That wasn't so bad. The part Margie hated most was the <span class="highlight-vocab">slot<span class="vocab-tooltip">a given space, time or position</span></span> where she had to put homework and test papers. She always had to write them out in a punch code they made her learn when she was six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated the marks in no time.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">slot</div>
        <div class="definition">a given space, time or position</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>The Inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted Margie's head. He said to her mother, "It's not the little girl's fault, Mrs Jones. I think the geography sector was <span class="highlight-vocab">geared<span class="vocab-tooltip">adjusted to a particular standard or level</span></span> a little too quick. Those things happen sometimes. I've slowed it up to an average ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory." And he patted Margie's head again.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">geared</div>
        <div class="definition">adjusted to a particular standard or level</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken Tommy's teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out <span class="highlight-vocab">completely<span class="vocab-tooltip">totally, entirely</span></span>.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">completely</div>
        <div class="definition">totally, entirely</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>So she said to Tommy, "Why would anyone write about school?"</p>
    
    <p>Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes. "Because it's not our kind of school, stupid. This is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago." He added <span class="highlight-vocab">loftily<span class="vocab-tooltip">in a superior way</span></span>, pronouncing the word <span class="highlight-vocab">carefully<span class="vocab-tooltip">with caution and attention</span></span>, "Centuries ago."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">loftily</div>
        <div class="definition">in a superior way</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">carefully</div>
        <div class="definition">with caution and attention</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Margie was hurt. "Well, I don't know what kind of school they had all that time ago." She read the book over his shoulder for a while, then said, "Anyway, they had a teacher."</p>
    
    <p>They had a teacher... It was a man.</p>
    
    <p>"Sure they had a teacher, but it wasn't a <span class="highlight-vocab">regular<span class="vocab-tooltip">normal; of the usual kind</span></span> teacher. It was a man."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">regular</div>
        <div class="definition">normal; of the usual kind</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>"A man? How could a man be a teacher?"</p>
    
    <p>"Well, he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions."</p>
    
    <p>"A man isn't smart enough."</p>
    
    <p>"Sure he is. My father knows as much as my teacher."</p>
    
    <p>"He knows almost as much, I <span class="highlight-vocab">betcha<span class="vocab-tooltip">(I) bet you (in fast speech): I'm sure</span></span>."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">betcha</div>
        <div class="definition">(I) bet you (in fast speech): I'm sure</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Margie wasn't prepared to <span class="highlight-vocab">dispute<span class="vocab-tooltip">disagree with</span></span> that. She said, "I wouldn't want a strange man in my house to teach me."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">dispute</div>
        <div class="definition">disagree with</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Tommy screamed with laughter. "You don't know much, Margie. The teachers didn't live in the house. They had a special building and all the kids went there."</p>
    
    <p>"And all the kids learned the same thing?"</p>
    
    <p>"Sure, if they were the same age."</p>
    
    <p>"But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught <span class="highlight-vocab">differently<span class="vocab-tooltip">in a different manner</span></span>."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">differently</div>
        <div class="definition">in a different manner</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>"Just the same they didn't do it that way then. If you don't like it, you don't have to read the book."</p>
    
    <p>"I didn't say I didn't like it," Margie said <span class="highlight-vocab">quickly<span class="vocab-tooltip">rapidly, at a fast pace</span></span>. She wanted to read about those funny schools.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">quickly</div>
        <div class="definition">rapidly, at a fast pace</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>They weren't even half finished when Margie's mother called, "Margie! School!"</p>
    
    <p>Margie looked up. "Not yet, Mamma."</p>
    
    <p>"Now!" said Mrs Jones. "And it's probably time for Tommy, too."</p>
    
    <p>Margie said to Tommy, "Can I read the book some more with you after school?"</p>
    
    <p>"May be," he said <span class="highlight-vocab">nonchalantly<span class="vocab-tooltip">not showing much interest or enthusiasm; carelessly</span></span>. He walked away whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">nonchalantly</div>
        <div class="definition">not showing much interest or enthusiasm; carelessly</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the same time every day except Saturday and Sunday, because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours.</p>
    
    <p>The screen was lit up, and it said: "Today's arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please insert yesterday's homework in the proper slot."</p>
    
    <p>Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather's grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom, going home together at the end of the day. They learned the same things, so they could help one another with the homework and talk about it.</p>
    
    <p>And the teachers were people...</p>
    
    <p>The mechanical teacher was flashing on the screen: "When we add fractions ½ and ¼..."</p>
    
    <p>Margie was thinking about how the kids must have loved it in the old days. She was thinking about the fun they had.</p>
