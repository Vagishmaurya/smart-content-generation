                answer: "Innisfree is a peaceful, natural place. The poet wants to build a small cabin made of clay and wattles, plant nine rows of beans, and keep a beehive for honey."
            },

                answer: "The poet hears crickets singing and sees midnight that's full of stars ('all a glimmer'), noon with purple light, and evenings filled with birds (linnets). This brings him peace that 'comes dropping slow'."

                answer: "The poet contrasts the natural beauty of Innisfree with his current urban surroundings of 'roadway' and 'pavements grey', suggesting the city's artificial, colorless environment versus nature's peace and beauty."

                answer: "Innisfree represents both a real place and a state of mind symbolizing peace and harmony with nature. The poet clearly misses this place from his boyhood as shown by his deep longing to return and the way the memories persist 'in the deep heart's core' even while he's in the city."

                answer: "These expressions create vivid sensory images: 'bee-loud glade' evokes the humming sound of busy bees in a peaceful clearing; 'evenings full of the linnet's wings' creates a visual of birds in flight at dusk; 'lake water lapping with low sounds' gives the gentle, rhythmic sound of water touching the shore."

                answer: "These lines suggest peace as something that gradually descends like morning dew or mist (veils of the morning), settling gently upon the natural world where crickets make their music. It creates an image of tranquility gradually enveloping the landscape from dawn, suggesting peace as a natural, unhurried process."
