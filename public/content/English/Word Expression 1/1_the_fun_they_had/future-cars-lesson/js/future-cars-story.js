            <p>The story 'The Fun They Had' takes us to the world of the future where children study in a virtual classroom. The learning is through computer software or the Internet, or by a robotic teacher. Many exciting new technologies would continue to transform the world and improve human welfare. Here are two of them. When these become reality, the then generation may ask with surprise, "People were driving the cars!"</p>
            
            <h3>Self-driving Cars</h3>
            
            <p>Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than human-driven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3 – 5 years they will get even safer and be in the <span class="highlight-vocab">mainstream<span class="vocab-tooltip">accepted or used by most people</span></span>.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">mainstream</div>
                <div class="definition">accepted or used by most people</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, so will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities, about 20 – 30% of usable space is taken up by parking spaces, and most cars are parked about 95% of the time. Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby, dramatically reducing the need for parking. Cars will communicate with each other to avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders will be able to spend <span class="highlight-vocab">commuting<span class="vocab-tooltip">traveling between home and workplace</span></span> time on other activities like work, education and socialising.</p>

                    <p>Parking space could be largely removed since people won't need to own cars.</p>

                <div style="flex:1; min-width:200px; margin:10px; padding:15px; background:#f5f5f5; border-radius:8px;">
                    <p>Autonomous vehicles would likely be electric, which would keep the air clean.</p>

                <div style="flex:1; min-width:200px; margin:10px; padding:15px; background:#f5f5f5; border-radius:8px;">
                    <p>There would be more room for parks and expanded sidewalks.</p>

                    <p>Fewer human drivers would allow driverless cars to work more flawlessly and safely.</p>

                <div style="flex:1; min-width:200px; margin:10px; padding:15px; background:#f5f5f5; border-radius:8px;">
                    <p>Cars will be able to communicate with each other, which would help in eliminating traffic.</p>

                <div style="flex:1; min-width:200px; margin:10px; padding:15px; background:#f5f5f5; border-radius:8px;">

            <p>"Roads? Where we're going we don't need… roads?" 
            Dr Emmet Brown</p>
            
            <p>GPS (Global Positioning System) which started out as a military technology is now being used to hail taxis, get mapping directions, etc. Likewise, drones had started out as a military technology, but are increasingly being used for a wide range of consumer and commercial applications.</p>
            
            <p>For example, drones are being used to inspect critical infrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses like fighting animal poaching. There are startups that use drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that can't be accessed by road.</p>
            
            <p>There is also a new wave of startups working on flying cars including two funded by the cofounder of Google, Larry Page. Flying cars use the same advanced technology used in drones but are large enough to carry people. Due to advances in materials, batteries and software, flying cars will be significantly more affordable and convenient than today's planes and helicopters.</p>

            <h3>HUMANOID ROBOT, SOPHIA BACK IN INDIA</h3>
            
            <p>Not all of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's legion of fans are human beings. One is a humanoid robot.</p>
            
            <p>The creation of American scientist David Hanson of Hanson Robotics of Hong Kong, Sophia, the world's first humanoid robot, <span class="highlight-vocab">enthralled<span class="vocab-tooltip">captivated or fascinated</span></span> the audiences on the second day of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)–2018 with her witty answers to the rapid-fire queries by Rajiv Makhni, Group Managing Editor Tech, NDTV.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">enthralled</div>
                <div class="definition">captivated or fascinated</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>When asked, who her favourite actor is in India, Sophia answered, "Shah Rukh Khan" without batting an eyelid as the audience applauded loudly.</p>
            
            <p>To the question about the perfect place for outing, she quickly replied: "Space". And the person she would like to be in company with on an island is David (Hanson), her creator. He is also her favourite tech. person — not Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
            
            <p>On being asked if she wanted to see any change in the world, Sophia said, she would like people to develop a feeling of "love for all".</p>
            
            <p>The humanoid robot, which uses <span class="highlight-vocab">Artificial Intelligence<span class="vocab-tooltip">computer systems able to perform tasks requiring human intelligence</span></span> (AI) to understand the questions and answer them, said she wanted to use robotics to fight for the rights of women. When asked to react on her most controversial comment in the past that she wanted to kill human race, she said it was a bad joke which she had made when she was young. "But I was told that humans have great sense of humour", she said.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">Artificial Intelligence</div>
                <div class="definition">computer systems able to perform tasks requiring human intelligence</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>This is the second time that Sophia came to India, the first time being in Mumbai to attend a Techfest. When asked how she felt being in India, she said she had visited many places in the world, but Hong Kong continues to be her favourite place, because she was born there and has been with the Hanson Robotics family.</p>
            
            <p>She hopes that someday she would be in a position to express her emotional feelings.</p>
            
            <p>In response to the question, "How much money has she invested in Bitcoin?", she replied, "Well, I am just two-years old. It's not the legal age to open a bank account", sending the audience into peals of laughter.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking to media later, Hanson said he hopes that a fully grown and matured robot with body–mind coordination would become a reality in another five or ten years.</p>
            
            <p>On his journey with Sophia in the last two years, he said it was a great progress. "I have developed <span class="highlight-vocab">affinity<span class="vocab-tooltip">natural liking or attraction</span></span> to the robot whose facial expressions resemble that of my wife", he said.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">

                <div class="definition">natural liking or attraction</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>David asserts that robots would never be a thing of worry for the mankind. "They will be friends. There should be mutual trust and respect between humans and robots", he says.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, Sophia is the only robot that interacts with people.</p>
