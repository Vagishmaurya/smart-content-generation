            <p>I had been very wealthy and prosperous and was leading a very comfortable life. I had all the worldly pleasures with me. But soon I became bored of my idle life. The urge to go on a voyage became stronger and stronger day by day. It <span class="highlight-vocab">haunted<span class="vocab-tooltip">obsessed, troubled persistently</span></span> me like anything. So one day I boarded a ship and went trading from island to island with other merchants.</p>

            <p>When we started, the weather was fine and the sea was calm. But on the fourth day of our voyage, our ship was caught in a <span class="highlight-vocab">terrific<span class="vocab-tooltip">extremely severe or intense</span></span> hurricane and we wandered from our set course. The <span class="highlight-vocab">tempest<span class="vocab-tooltip">violent windy storm</span></span> continued for several days and drove us near an island. The captain of the ship was <span class="highlight-vocab">reluctant<span class="vocab-tooltip">unwilling, hesitant</span></span> to cast anchor at the port as it was a much dreaded place.</p>

It swallowed him and went away. Terror stricken I clung to the branch of the tree tightly and I did not know when I fell asleep. It was daylight when I awoke. I climbed down. It seemed to me that I had no courage left. It took me no time to realise that if I would not think of a way to escape soon, I would be a dead man. It was just a matter of time when I would also be swallowed like my two other companions. The <span class="highlight-vocab">instinct<span class="vocab-tooltip">natural tendency</span></span> to prevent one's life is greater than any fear or <span class="highlight-vocab">frustration<span class="vocab-tooltip">feeling of being upset or annoyed</span></span>.</p>

            <p>I thought I should spare no means to save myself. I collected a lot of dry wood and bushes and tied them into a bundle with <span class="highlight-vocab">reeds<span class="vocab-tooltip">tall grasses that grow in wet areas</span></span>. I arranged them in a circular structure round the tree and tied some of them with the branches of the tree. In this way I made a tent like structure in which I sat after dusk and securely tied from within. I had the satisfaction that whatever I could do I did it to prevent myself. This time when the serpent arrived he crept round the tree but he could not <span class="highlight-vocab">penetrate<span class="vocab-tooltip">force a way into or through</span></span> the <span class="highlight-vocab">defensive<span class="vocab-tooltip">serving to protect or defend</span></span> structure I had made around me.
