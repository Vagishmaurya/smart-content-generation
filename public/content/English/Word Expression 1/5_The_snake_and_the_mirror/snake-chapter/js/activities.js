The Brave Hearts

On October 26, 2009, Jhalaram's hut in the village Sarneshwar in Rajasthan, suddenly caught fire. His two daughters, aged two-and-a-half years and one year, as well as ten goats were in the hut at that time.

Shrawan Kumar, a six-year old boy, was playing in his house at a distance of about 200 feet. Seeing smoke coming out from Jhalaram's house, he ran towards it. He saw the children sitting on a cot and screaming for help, and the goats caught in the flames.

Shrawan entered the house, lifted the younger child in one arm and pulling the older one by the hand, brought them out safely. He took them to his house, then ran to inform his father and the children's father.

The elders rushed to the site. But by that time, the goats had died and the household belongings had been destroyed in the fire. It was Shrawan Kumar's daring act that saved the lives of the two children.
