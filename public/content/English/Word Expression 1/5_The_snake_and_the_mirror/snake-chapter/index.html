                    <p>Humans have always had a complex relationship with snakes. In some cultures, they are revered and considered sacred, while in others they are feared and seen as symbols of danger. This chapter explores different perspectives on snakes through a thrilling adventure story and beautiful poems.</p>
                    <p>In this lesson, we will explore "The Miraculous Escape," a story about survival and the instinct to protect oneself from danger, along with poems that offer different views on snakes and their place in our world.</p>

The old man said, "How can sons and daughters be intelligent without learning from their parents?" The young man said, "How did you as a parent learn?" The old man said, "Why are you hijacking my question by asking me back?" The young man said, "Didn't you know that you as a parent, now have learnt all the things on your own?" The old man said, "How do you say that we all learnt from others?" The young man said, "Why do you ask me about how to operate electronic gadget all the time?" The old man said, "Why can't I ask you because I have paid for the gadget you use?"

He chewed the bone for a very long time and this made him quite thirsty. He came to a stream to quench his thirst. He trotted around the footbridge and happened to glance into the water. He saw his own reflection in the water. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger bone, he growled and scowled <span class="error-word">towards</span> it. The reflection growled and scowled back. Being greedy by nature, he wanted that bone too. He snapped his sharp teeth at the image on the water. He barked at the other dog, hoping to scare him into giving that bone. His own big bone fell with a splash, went <span class="error-word">over of</span> sight, the moment he opened his mouth to bite!</p>

                        <p>The stories of 'The Snake and the Mirror' and 'The Miraculous Escape' show how people face danger and are scared of animals. As children, many of us fear stray dogs. Both adults and children are scared of snakes. Fear exists in most of us. Some fears have bases and others do not. Let us conduct a survey of what people fear about. You may follow the guidelines given below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Form groups of four, and select an area for your survey. It may be your classmates, teachers or people in your neighbourhood.</li>
                            <li>Develop a questionnaire to collect information about the fears people have. You may have at least eight to ten questions.</li>
                            <li>Decide how many people you will ask the questions for the survey.</li>
                            <li>Ask people the questions.</li>
                            <li>Write their opinions in tabular form.</li>
                            <li>Now write the first draft of the report.</li>
                            <li>You may add graphic representations of the information and the data collected.</li>
                            <li>Edit and write the report to make it final.</li>
                            <li>Present it in a report form to the class.</li>
                            <li>You can also make a PowerPoint presentation.</li>

                    <div class="content-block">
                        <p>Spelling differences exist between British and American English. For example:</p>
                        <p>British: Colour, Honour, Programme, Travelling, Fulfil, Centre, Dialogue, Grey</p>
                        <p>American: Color, Honor, Program, Traveling, Fulfill, Center, Dialog, Gray</p>
                        <p>Common errors with commas include using them when they're not necessary. For example:</p>
                        <p>Incorrect: Hari never went into the city, because he did not feel comfortable driving in traffic.</p>
                        <p>Correct: Hari never went into the city because he did not feel comfortable driving in traffic.</p>
                        <p>Also, be careful with expressions like "on and off" versus "off and on" which have specific meanings:</p>
                        <p>"On and off" means at regular intervals</p>
                        <p>"Off and on" means occasionally</p>
