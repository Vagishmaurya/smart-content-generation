            <p>This is an extract from Harper Lee's To Kill a Mocking Bird.</p>
            
            <p>After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, "Scout, ready to read?". I ran <span class="highlight-vocab">crying<span class="vocab-tooltip">expressing loud sounds of grief</span></span>, went to the front porch. Atticus followed me. "Something wrong, Scout?" I told Atticus I didn't feel very well and didn't think I'd go to school any more if it was alright with him. Atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers <span class="highlight-vocab">wandered<span class="vocab-tooltip">moved about without a fixed course or aim</span></span> to his watch pocket; he said that was the only way he could think. He waited in <span class="highlight-vocab">amiable<span class="vocab-tooltip">friendly, pleasant, good-natured</span></span> silence, and I sought to <span class="highlight-vocab">reinforce<span class="vocab-tooltip">strengthen or support</span></span> my position: "You never went to school and you do alright, so I'll just stay home too. You can teach me like <span class="highlight-vocab">Granddaddy<span class="vocab-tooltip">grandfather (informal)</span></span> taught you 'n' Uncle Jack." "No I can't", said Atticus. "I have to make a living. Besides, they'd put me in jail if I kept you at home. Now what's the matter? Bit by bit, I told him the day's misfortunes. "And the teacher said you taught me all wrong, so we can't ever read any more, ever. Please don't send me back, please Sir." Atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed his <span class="highlight-vocab">examination<span class="vocab-tooltip">inspection, observation</span></span> of the <span class="highlight-vocab">wisteria vine<span class="vocab-tooltip">a genus of flowering plants</span></span> he strolled back to me. "First of all", he said, "if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view-" "Sir?" "-until you climb into his skin and walk around in it". "But if I keep on goin' to school, we can't ever read any more…" "That's really <span class="highlight-vocab">bothering<span class="vocab-tooltip">causing worry, anxiety, or trouble</span></span> you, isn't it?" "Yes sir."</p>

            <p>When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something. "Do you know what a <span class="highlight-vocab">compromise<span class="vocab-tooltip">agreement reached by mutual concession</span></span> is?", he asked. "Bending the law?" "No, an agreement reached by mutual <span class="highlight-vocab">concessions<span class="vocab-tooltip">things that are yielded or surrendered</span></span>. It works this way", he said. "If you'll concede the necessity of going to school, we'll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a <span class="highlight-vocab">bargain<span class="vocab-tooltip">an agreement between two or more people</span></span>?"</p>

                the way it is done.<br>

                How I miss my father!<br>
                He cooked like a person<br>
