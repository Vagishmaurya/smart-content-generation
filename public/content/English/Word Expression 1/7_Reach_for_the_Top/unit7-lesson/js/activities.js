// Hugh Herr content for listening activity
const hughHerrContent = `
Harvard-MIT researcher, Hugh Herr, is familiar with the obstacles faced by amputees. A world-class mountain climber at the age of 17, Herr and a friend were trapped in a snowstorm while ascending New Hampshire's Mount Washington in 1982. After three days without food or camping gear, the two were rescued, but frostbite cost Herr both his legs, which were amputated just below the knee.

Herr was fitted with prostheses, but he soon discovered that they were developed for walking on flat surfaces, and not for taking on advanced functions like climbing or running. With the same determination that he once applied to climbing, he set out to create a better prosthetic leg. He worked with an engineering shop to fashion his own prostheses, tinkering with customised sockets and lighter materials. He even designed artificial feet specially made for climbing rock (built flat and narrow for getting a toehold in cracks and ice featuring sharp spikes).

"I experienced a tremendous amount of pain from prosthetic limbs at first", Herr says. "So I decided to go back to school and learn about physics and engineering to try to solve these problems." Herr obtained a Master's degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1993 and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard five years later.

After struggling for a decade to come up with a better prosthetic limb, just getting the knee to market will be a personal triumph for Herr — yet another mountain conquered. "It's been a long road", he says. "But I think I'm finally in a position to make a difference."
