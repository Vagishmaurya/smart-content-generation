// Gautama Buddha and Angulimala story content for listening activity
const buddhaStoryContent = `
Gautama Buddha was journeying through the Kosala region. He was warned not to pass through the deep jungle, as it was the den of a famous robber chief, Angulimala. He was the terror of the whole countryside. He lived by plundering travellers and feared no one. He had committed many murders. All attempts to capture the inhuman Angulimala had failed. So he continued his crimes unpunished. The people of Kosala pleaded with the Buddha not to expose himself to the dangers of the robber's territory.

But Gautama Buddha knew no fear. The warnings of the people of Kosala did not affect him. He made his way into the jungle. Angulimala got enraged at this boldness. He was determined to kill the intruder. But when he saw the Buddha, calm and self-possessed, and heard his words of kindness, the robber hesitated. His arm, which had been uplifted to kill, fell helpless by his side. His wrath cooled, and he knelt down before the Buddha. He confessed all his sins and declared his faith in the Buddha.

When the people saw the new disciple following his Master, they were amazed and could not believe that this was the ferocious man who had been a terror for so long. Angulimala became a monk. His past was forgotten, and he was widely respected for his holiness.

    bio: `
        Stephen William Hawking (1942-2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. His scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.
        
        Despite being diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND) that gradually paralysed him over the decades, Hawking continued to work, communicate, and inspire people around the world. After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating deviceâ€”initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.
    `,
    books: `
        Stephen Hawking authored several groundbreaking books that made complex scientific concepts accessible to general readers:
        
        1. "A Brief History of Time" (1988): His most famous work that explains cosmology, black holes, and the Big Bang for non-specialist readers. It became a bestseller with over 10 million copies sold.
        
        2. "The Universe in a Nutshell" (2001): A follow-up that updates readers on developments in theoretical physics.
        
        3. "A Briefer History of Time" (2005): A more accessible version of his original bestseller.
        
        4. "The Grand Design" (2010, co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow): Explores the major questions about the universe and existence.
        
        5. "Brief Answers to the Big Questions" (2018): His final book, published posthumously, addressing ten fundamental questions about our existence.
    `,
    achievements: `
        Stephen Hawking's scientific achievements include:
        
        1. Hawking Radiation: His theoretical discovery that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects.
        
        2. Penrose-Hawking Singularity Theorems: Proved with Roger Penrose that if general relativity is correct and certain reasonable conditions are satisfied, then space-time must have singularities.
        
        3. No-Boundary Proposal: With James Hartle, he proposed that the universe has no boundary in imaginary time, suggesting the universe spontaneously appeared from nothing.
        
        4. Black Hole Information Paradox: His work on the paradox of information loss in black holes sparked decades of theoretical work.
        
        5. Scientific Communication: Perhaps his greatest achievement was making complex physics accessible to millions of people worldwide despite his physical limitations.
        
        In addition to his scientific work, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a member of the US National Academy of Sciences.
