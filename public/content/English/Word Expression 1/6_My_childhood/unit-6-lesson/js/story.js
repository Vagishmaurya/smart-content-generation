            <h3>Text I</h3>
            
            <p>I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar for Rajkot to become a member of the Rajasthanik Court. There I was put into a primary school, and I can well recollect those days, including the names and other particulars of the teachers who taught me. As at Porbandar, so here, there is hardly anything to note about my studies. I could only have been a <span class="highlight-vocab">mediocre<span class="vocab-tooltip">average or ordinary quality</span></span> student. From this school I went to the suburban school and thence to high school, having already reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever told a lie, during this short period, either to my teachers or to my school-mates. However, I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My books and my lessons were my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and to run back home as soon as the school closed ‚Äî that was my daily habit. There is an incident which occurred at the examination during my first year at high school and which is worth recording. Mr Giles, the educational Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to <span class="highlight-vocab">prompt<span class="vocab-tooltip">cause someone to take a course of action</span></span> as a spelling exercise. One of the words was 'Kettle'.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">mediocre</div>
                <div class="definition">average or ordinary quality</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">prompt</div>
                <div class="definition">cause someone to take a course of action</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>I had misspelt it. The teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my neighbour's slate, for I had thought that the teacher was there to supervise us against copying. The result was that all the boys, except myself, were found to have spelt every word correctly. I could never learn the art of 'copying'. Yet the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my teacher. I was by nature, blind to the faults of elders. Later I came to know of many other failings of this teacher, but my regard for him remained the same. Two other incidents belonging to the same period have always clung to my memory. As a rule I had distaste for any reading beyond my school books. The daily lessons had to be done, because I disliked being taken to task by my teacher as much as I disliked <span class="highlight-vocab">deceiving<span class="vocab-tooltip">give a mistaken impression</span></span> him. Therefore I would do the lessons, but often without my mind in them. Thus, when even the lessons could not be done properly, there was of course no question of any extra reading. But somehow my eyes fell on a book purchased by my father. It was Shravana Pitribhakti Nataka. I read it with intense interest. One of the pictures I was shown was of Shravana carrying, by means of slings fitted for his shoulders, his blind parents on a pilgrimage. The book and the picture left an <span class="highlight-vocab">indelible<span class="vocab-tooltip">not able to be forgotten</span></span> impression on my mind.</p>

            <p>Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi is an Indian American business executive. She is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pepsico. She is one among the world's most powerful women. She delivered the following speech at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on 14 December 2013. She was named one of the 25 Greatest Living Legends by NDTV, and was awarded by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhawan.</p>
            
            <p>Read the speech delivered by Indra Nooyi and answer the questions that follow.</p>
            
            <p>Mr President and NDTV, thank you very much for this incredible honour.</p>
            
            <p>Malcom Gladwell in his book, Outliers says: "Who you are cannot be separated from where you came from."</p>
            
            <p>I left India 35 years ago, went to the USA and had tremendous success in the <span class="highlight-vocab">meritocracy<span class="vocab-tooltip">a ruling or influential class of educated or able people</span></span>. But none of that could have happened if I would not have had wonderful upbringing very much here in India. So I have a lot to thank India for. Now my three lessons I would like to share with you.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">meritocracy</div>
                <div class="definition">a ruling or influential class of educated or able people</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>First, please be a lifelong student. You know when we were kids, we used to ask questions like "Why is the sky blue?", "Why the birds flying so high?" But for some reasons, as we get older, that curiosity goes away. And if we are happy with the knowledge we have, then we are actually going to <span class="highlight-vocab">atrophy<span class="vocab-tooltip">gradual decline in effectiveness or vigour due to underuse or neglect</span></span>. So, please remain a lifelong student, don't lose that curiosity.</p>
            
            <div class="vocabulary-note">
                <div class="word">atrophy</div>
                <div class="definition">gradual decline in effectiveness or vigour due to underuse or neglect</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Second, whatever you do, throw yourself into it, throw your head, heart and hands into it. I look at my job not as a job, I look at it as a Calling, as a Passion and I don't care about the hours, about the hardships, because to me everything is a joy. So whatever you do, please look upon it as a Calling, a Passion, not as a job, not as something temporary.</p>
            
            <p>The third and the most important one, please help others rise. Greatness comes not from a position, but from helping build a future. All of us in position of power have an obligation to pull others up. You know, as I stand here today, I look at my responsibility not as accepting an honour, I look upon it as accepting a challenge and a responsibility, an obligation to actually make it possible for people who are younger to come up and achieve levels of greatness, so they too can be on the stage sometime in the future.</p>
