                text: "What does Mandela mean by 'twin obligations'? What made it impossible for him to fulfill both obligations?",
                answer: "Twin obligations refers to (1) obligations to family (parents, wife, children) and (2) obligations to people, community and country. In apartheid South Africa, a man of color who tried to fulfill his duty to his people was inevitably separated from his family. Attempting to serve his people prevented him from fulfilling his family obligations."

                text: "How did Mandela's understanding of freedom change with age and experience?",
                answer: "As a boy, he thought he was born free. As a student, he wanted freedom only for himself (staying out at night, reading what he pleased). As a young man in Johannesburg, he wanted basic freedoms (achieving potential, earning a living, having a family). Finally, he realized freedom was collective - he could not enjoy his limited freedoms while his people were not free."

                text: "How did 'depths of oppression create heights of character' according to Mandela?",
                answer: "The harsh apartheid system produced extraordinary leaders like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, and others with remarkable courage, wisdom and generosity. The extreme suffering and oppression fostered exceptional moral character and resilience in those who fought against it."

                text: "What were the ideals Mandela set out for the future of South Africa in his inaugural address?",
                answer: "Mandela pledged to liberate all people from poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination. He declared that South Africa would never again experience the oppression of one by another. He emphasized political emancipation, human dignity, justice, and peace for all people regardless of color."

                type: "essay",
                text: "What is Mandela's understanding of courage and hatred based on his personal experiences?",
                answer: "Courage: Not the absence of fear, but triumph over it. The brave person feels afraid but conquers fear. He learned this from seeing comrades endure torture without breaking.\n\nHatred: Not innate but learned. 'No one is born hating another person because of their skin color.' People can be taught to love just as they learn to hate. Love is more natural to the human heart than hatred."

                id: "eq3",
                type: "essay",
                text: "Why does Mandela say that the oppressor and the oppressed both need to be liberated?",
                answer: "Mandela believes a person who takes away another's freedom becomes 'a prisoner of hatred' and 'locked behind bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness.' True freedom means not taking freedom from others. Both oppressed and oppressor lose their humanity in an oppressive system. Liberation must be mutual for a society to heal."

                text: "Describe the different places where the tiger should be, according to the poet.",
                answer: "According to the poet, the tiger should be lurking in shadow, sliding through long grass near the water hole where deer pass. It should also be snarling around houses at the jungle's edge, terrorizing the village with its white fangs and claws."
            },

                type: "paragraph",
                text: "What is the contrast drawn between the tiger in the zoo and in the wild?",
                answer: "In the zoo, the tiger is locked in a concrete cell, limited to stalking in small steps in his cage, ignoring visitors. In the wild, he would be free to hunt, lurk in shadows, slide through grass, and terrorize villages. The contrast is between captivity and freedom, between restricted and natural behavior."

                type: "paragraph",
                text: "What effect does the repetition of 'brilliant' create in the last stanza?",
                answer: "The repetition of 'brilliant' (in 'brilliant eyes' and 'brilliant stars') creates a connection between the tiger and the cosmos. It emphasizes the contrast between his confinement and the vastness of the night sky, highlighting his longing for freedom and the natural world."

                type: "essay",
                text: "What is the message of this poem? What does the poet want to convey through this poem?",
                answer: "The poem conveys the message that wild animals should not be confined in zoos, as captivity restricts their natural behavior and instincts. The poet wants to highlight the cruelty of removing animals from their natural habitat and the contrast between the tiger's limited existence in a cage versus its powerful, free life in the wild. There's a sense of the tiger's dignity despite confinement, as it continues to look beyond its prison to the stars."

                id: "dq2",
                type: "essay",
                text: "Are zoos necessary for the protection or conservation of some species of animals? Are there alternatives to zoos?",
                answer: "Zoos can play important roles in conservation of endangered species, breeding programs, research, and education. However, they also restrict animals' natural behaviors and can cause psychological distress. Alternatives include wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, protected reserves, and rehabilitation centers that provide more natural habitats while still offering protection. Virtual and augmented reality experiences could also educate people about animals without confining them."

                id: "dq3",
                type: "essay",
                text: "Compare the poem 'A Tiger in the Zoo' with Nelson Mandela's experience of imprisonment and freedom.",
                answer: "Both the tiger and Mandela experienced confinement and a loss of natural freedom. The tiger is physically restricted to a cage, while Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years. Both maintained dignity in confinement - the tiger still has its 'brilliant eyes' and gazes at stars; Mandela retained his principles and humanity. Both yearn for true freedom - the tiger should be in the wild; Mandela fought for freedom not just for himself but for his people. Both stories show how unnatural and harmful it is to restrict freedom, whether for animals or humans."
