                text: "What kind of a person is Valli? Describe her character based on the story.",
                answer: "Valli is determined, independent, self-respecting, curious, observant, mature for her age, responsible with money, careful, clever, and resourceful. She plans her journey meticulously and handles herself with dignity despite being just eight years old."

                text: "How did Valli plan her bus journey? What details did she gather about the bus?",
                answer: "Valli gathered details by listening to conversations and asking discreet questions. She learned that the town was six miles away, the fare was thirty paise one way, the journey took 45 minutes, and she could return on the same bus by paying another thirty paise."

                text: "Why does Valli refuse to look out of the window on her way back?",
                answer: "Valli refuses to look out because she had seen the dead cow by the roadside - the same cow she had laughed at earlier when it was running in front of the bus. This disturbing sight of death dampened her enthusiasm and affected her deeply."

                text: "What does Valli mean when she says, \"I was just agreeing with what you said about things happening without our knowledge\"?",
                answer: "Valli is referring to her secret bus journey that happened without her mother's knowledge. The statement is ironic because while her mother speaks generally about things happening without people's awareness, she has no idea that her own daughter had just taken a bus journey all by herself."

                answer: "The story explores the themes of childhood curiosity, growing up, independence, and the first encounter with mortality. Through Valli's bus journey, the author shows her transition from innocence to a more mature understanding of the world. The dead cow incident marks her initiation into the reality of death, showing the gap between knowing that death exists and truly understanding it."

                answer: "The author captures Valli's childlike wonder and perspective throughout the story. Examples: her fascination with the bus, her description of scenery with repetitions ('green, green, green'), her joyful reaction to the cow running in front of the bus, her repulsion towards the old woman with betel nut, and her shift from laughter to sadness upon seeing the dead cow."

Discuss how Valli's world without modern technology differs from contemporary childhood experiences."

                answer: "Despite having big sharp teeth, spikes, scales, a mouth like a fireplace, and daggers on his toes - all fierce features - Custard behaves cowardly by crying for a safe cage while the smaller pets act brave."

                text: "What is the tone of the poem? Is it serious or light-hearted?",
                answer: "The poem has a light-hearted, humorous tone with playful language like 'realio, trulio' and the contrast between Custard's fierce appearance and cowardly behavior. The poem seems to be a fun children's ballad rather than a serious poem."

                answer: "The poem contains rhyming couplets (house/mouse, wagon/dragon), similes ('brave as a barrel full of bears', 'brave as a tiger in a rage'), alliteration ('big black', 'little yellow'), repetition ('little', 'realio, trulio'), and playful made-up words ('realio, trulio')."

                text: "How does the poem use humor? Give examples.",
                answer: "The poem uses humor through the contrast between appearance and behavior (fierce dragon being cowardly), the playful made-up words, the exaggerated descriptions of bravery, and the ironic situation of the smallest creatures claiming to be the bravest."
