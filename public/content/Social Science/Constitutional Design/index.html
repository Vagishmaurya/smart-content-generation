                    <p>What makes a country democratic? Is it just about holding elections and having elected representatives? Or is there something more to it? In this lesson, we'll explore how constitutions form the foundation of democratic societies.</p>
                    <p>We'll learn about the inspiring story of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy, understand why constitutions are necessary, and discover how India's own constitution was created. Let's begin this journey to understand the rules that govern our democratic life!</p>

                    Overview
                </h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>We noted in the previous chapter that in a democracy the rulers are not free to do what they like. There are certain basic rules that the citizens and the government have to follow. All such rules together are called constitution. As the supreme law of the country, the constitution determines the rights of citizens, the powers of the government and how the government should function.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this chapter we ask some basic questions about the constitutional design of a democracy. Why do we need a constitution? How are the constitutions drawn up? Who designs them and in what way? What are the values that shape the constitutions in democratic states? Once a constitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the changing conditions?</p>
                    
                    <p>One recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is that of South Africa. We begin this chapter by looking at what happened there and how the South Africans went about this task of designing their constitution. Then we turn to how the Indian Constitution was made, what its foundational values are, and how it provides a good framework for the conduct of citizens' life and that of the government.</p>

He and seven other leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for daring to oppose the apartheid regime in his country.

                    <p>Values that inspired and guided the freedom struggle and were in turn nurtured by it, formed the foundation for India's democracy. These values are embedded in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution. They guide all the articles of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution begins with a short statement of its basic values. This is called the Preamble to the constitution.</p>
