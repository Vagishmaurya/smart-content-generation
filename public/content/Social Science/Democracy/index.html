                    What is democracy? The word 'democracy' comes from two Greek words: 'demos' meaning people, and 'kratia' meaning rule. So democracy literally means rule by the people. But what does this actually mean in practice? Let's explore the definition and history of democracy.

                    <p>Democracy cannot get us everything and is not the solution to all problems. But it is clearly better than any other alternative that we know. It offers better chances of a good decision, it is likely to respect people's own wishes and allows different kinds of people to live together. Even when it fails to do these things, it allows a way of correcting its mistakes and offers more dignity to all citizens.</p>
